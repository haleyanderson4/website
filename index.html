        <h6>Project Name: Add Some Salt</h6>
        <p>At the 2017 Twitchcon Hackathon, my team and I built a Twitch extension that uses facial recognition to register
          emotions and provides relevant emote overlay.</p>
        <p>This project is Facial Recognition Overlay for the Twitch streaming service. We use an API to track the
          face of the streamer on the screen and register the emotion of the streamer. Based on the emotion we detect,
          a different animation will pop up on the overlay. The main feature of this is called a salt meter. As a player's "anger"
          emotion increases, a meter will appear on the screen and track the amount of "saltiness" of the player. We
          accomplished this through java and html by parsing data from a java program into a javascript capable html
          link, which we then used as a constantly refreshing overlay for twitch streaming accounts.</p>
          <p>For this project I coded the Front End, which was a project in html and javascript that translated the facial recognition
            data into the emote, which toggled visibility depending on which emotion was the most present.</p>
